1. The UI will include dedicated authentication screens for login and registration with secure JWT token management.
2. A main dashboard will present a clear overview of decks with pagination, filtering, sorting, and intuitive navigation to manage deck details and flashcards.
3. A detailed deck view will display deck information along with a paginated list of flashcards and options for bulk operations.
4. Separate interfaces will be provided for manual flashcard creation and AI-generated flashcard proposals, though they will use the same endpoints for saving flashcards.
5. The user flow will guide users through generating flashcards via AI, reviewing proposals, and confirming bulk flashcard creation.
6. Responsive design and accessibility best practices (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) will be implemented across the UI.
7. Error handling will be implemented as inline validation messages for form inputs and toast notifications for system errors.
8. Centralized state management (using Redux or React Context API) will be used to synchronize API data across components. 
9. Caching strategies will not be implemented at this stage.
10. The navigation structure will be modular and scalable to accommodate future updates.
11. Modal dialogs and confirmation prompts will be used to validate critical user actions like deck deletion and bulk operations.
12. Real-time loading indicators and progress spinners will display during AI flashcard generation and data fetching/saving operations.
13. Dark mode support will be included to enhance user experience.
14. A search bar will be integrated to allow users to search for decks and flashcards.
15. Subtle animations and transition effects will be used to provide visual continuity and improve engagement.

<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
The UI architecture for the MVP will focus on creating a secure, responsive, and accessible interface that is tightly integrated with the API plan. The main screens include authentication views, a dashboard for deck management, and detailed deck views displaying flashcards. User flows are designed to guide users through deck creation, flashcard management (both manual and AI-generated), and bulk operations. API integration will be managed with centralized state management (using Redux or React Context) to ensure consistency across components. The design will emphasize responsiveness, modern navigation, inline error handling, and a combination of visual effects like subtle animations and dark mode support. Real-time loading indicators will improve user feedback during network operations, while modal dialogs enhance safety for critical actions.

# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: Delete Deck

## 1. Endpoint Overview
This endpoint is responsible for deleting a specific deck identified by its unique identifier (deckId) and ensuring that all related flashcards are also deleted via cascading (as defined in the database schema). The endpoint will be protected and will only allow authorized users to delete their own decks.

## 2. Request Details
- **HTTP Method:** DELETE
- **URL Structure:** /api/decks/{deckId}
- **Parameters:**
  - **Required:**
    - `deckId` (path parameter): The unique identifier of the deck to be deleted.
- **Request Body:** None

## 3. Used Types
- There is no explicit DTO for deletion as the operation is based on the deckId path parameter.
- Use the appropriate type definitions from `src/types.ts` (e.g., deck ID type as defined in Database schema).

## 4. Response Details
- **Success:**
  - HTTP Status: 204 No Content (indicates successful deletion with no response body)
- **Error Cases:**
  - 401 Unauthorized: If the user is not authenticated.
  - 404 Not Found: If the deck with the given deckId does not exist or the user does not have permission to delete it.
  - 500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected server errors.

## 5. Data Flow
1. The endpoint receives a DELETE request at `/api/decks/{deckId}` with a valid authentication token.
2. Authentication middleware validates the user (using Supabase authentication).
3. The deckId is extracted from the request URL.
4. The service layer (e.g., a dedicated deck service in `src/lib/services/deck.service.ts`) is called to perform the deletion:
   - Validate that the deck exists and belongs to the authenticated user.
   - Delete the deck record. The cascade delete on flashcards is handled automatically by the database foreign key constraints.
5. Depending on the outcome of the deletion, the service returns success or an error.

## 6. Security Considerations
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensure that only authenticated users can access this endpoint. Use the auth context (e.g., context.locals.supabase) to verify the user's identity and to confirm ownership of the deck.
- **Input Validation:** Validate the `deckId` to ensure it matches the expected UUID format.
- **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries in the service layer to prevent SQL injection.

## 7. Error Handling
- **404 Not Found:** If no deck is found with the specified deckId or if the deck does not belong to the authenticated user.
- **401 Unauthorized:** If the authentication token is missing or invalid.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** For any unexpected errors during deletion, log the error details on the server side for further investigation.

## 8. Performance Considerations
- Leverage the database cascade delete feature to efficiently remove related flashcards without additional queries.
- Ensure that deletion queries are executed as a single transaction to maintain data integrity.

## 9. Implementation Steps
1. **Route Handler Setup:**
   - Create or update the DELETE route in `/src/pages/api/decks/[deckId].ts`.
   - Ensure the route extracts the deckId from the URL and validates it.

2. **Authentication & Authorization:**
   - Use middleware to check for a valid authentication token.
   - Verify that the deck being deleted belongs to the authenticated user.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate the format of the deckId (UUID) using a library (e.g., Zod).

4. **Service Layer Integration:**
   - Call the deletion function in `src/lib/services/deck.service.ts`. If it does not exist, add a new method to handle deletion and cascade, ensuring that it uses a transaction if needed.

5. **Database Interaction:**
   - Use parameterized queries to delete the record.
   - Rely on the foreign key cascade delete constraint to remove related flashcards.

6. **Error Handling & Logging:**
   - Catch any errors and respond with the appropriate HTTP status codes (404, 401, 500).
   - Log errors for debugging purposes.

7. **Testing:**
   - Write tests to simulate deletion of a valid deck, unauthorized access, attempting to delete a non-existent deck, and ensuring cascade deletion behavior.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Update API documentation to reflect the new DELETE endpoint.

9. **Code Review & Deployment:**
   - Submit a pull request with the changes, and ensure all tests pass before merging.

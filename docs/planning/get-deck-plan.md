# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: Get Deck Details

## 1. Endpoint Overview
The GET /api/decks/{deckId} endpoint retrieves details for a specific deck. It is designed to fetch deck information from the database using the deck ID, and then return the deck details in a standard response format that aligns with the deck creation response.

## 2. Request Details
- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **URL Structure:** /api/decks/{deckId}
- **Parameters:**
  - **Path Parameter (Required):** deckId (UUID) – The unique identifier of the deck.
- **Request Body:** None

## 3. Used Types
- **DeckDTO:** Defined in `src/types.ts`, representing a deck record with fields:
  - id, title, metadata, created_at, updated_at, user_id.
- **CreateDeckResponse (alias):** Reuse the response structure from deck creation, which is aligned with DeckDTO.

## 4. Response Details
- **Success Response:**
  - **Status Code:** 200 OK
  - **Payload:** A JSON object conforming to DeckDTO (or the create deck response format).
- **Error Responses:**
  - 401 Unauthorized – When the user is not authenticated.
  - 404 Not Found – When the deck does not exist or does not belong to the authenticated user.
  - 500 Internal Server Error – For unexpected server errors.

## 5. Data Flow
1. The endpoint extracts the deckId from the URL path.
2. The authentication middleware verifies the user credentials and attaches the user information to the request context.
3. The service layer fetches the deck data from the database (e.g., using Supabase client) using the provided deckId.
4. The service validates that the deck exists and is owned by the authenticated user.
5. The endpoint returns the deck details if found or the appropriate error if not.

## 6. Security Considerations
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Use middleware to ensure the request includes a valid auth token.
  - Ensure the requested deck belongs to the authenticated user (authorization).
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate that deckId is a valid UUID format.
- **Threat Mitigation:**
  - Prevent unauthorized access by strictly checking user ownership of the deck.
  - Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.

## 7. Error Handling
- **Error Scenarios:**
  1. **Unauthorized (401):** If the request lacks valid authentication tokens.
  2. **Not Found (404):** If no deck is found with the given deckId or if the deck does not belong to the authenticated user.
  3. **Server Error (500):** Any unexpected error during processing.
- **Logging:**
  - Log errors with details, including timestamp, user information, and stack trace (if available) for debugging.

## 8. Performance Considerations
- **Database Indexing:**
  - Ensure that the `id` and `user_id` columns are indexed for fast lookup.
- **Efficient Querying:**
  - Retrieve only necessary fields as defined in DeckDTO.
- **Caching (if applicable):**
  - Consider caching deck details for high-traffic decks, while ensuring cache invalidation on updates.

## 9. Implementation Steps
1. **Define the API Route:**
   - Create a new API endpoint file at `src/pages/api/decks/[deckId].ts` to handle GET requests.
2. **Extract and Validate Input:**
   - Extract the deckId from the URL and validate it (check if it is a valid UUID).
3. **Authenticate the User:**
   - Leverage existing middleware to authenticate the request and retrieve the user data from the context.
4. **Call the Service Layer:**
   - Use (or create if necessary) a service function, e.g., `getDeckById(deckId, userId)`, to fetch deck details from the database via the Supabase client.
5. **Handle Non-Existent Decks:**
   - If no matching deck is found or the deck does not belong to the user, return a 404 status with an appropriate error message.
6. **Return Successful Response:**
   - If the deck is found, map the data to the DeckDTO format and return it with a 200 OK status.
7. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Wrap the process in try/catch blocks. Log any errors and return a 500 status if unexpected errors occur.
8. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests to validate endpoint behavior for valid requests, unauthorized access, not found errors, and server errors.
9. **Documentation:**
   - Update the API documentation to include this new endpoint and its expected behavior.

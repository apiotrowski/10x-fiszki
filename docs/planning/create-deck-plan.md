# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: Create Deck

## 1. Endpoint Overview
This endpoint is designed to create a new deck for a user. It accepts a title and metadata and returns the created deck details. The endpoint is secured, requiring user authentication.

## 2. Request Details
- HTTP Method: POST
- URL Structure: /api/decks
- Parameters:
  - Required: 
    - title: string (deck title)
    - metadata: object (additional optional information associated with the deck)
  - Optional: none
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
      "title": "New Deck",
      "metadata": {}
  }
  ```

## 3. Used Types
- Command Model: CreateDeckCommand
  - Fields: title, metadata
- DTO: DeckDTO
  - Fields: id, user_id, title, metadata, created_at, updated_at

## 4. Response Details
- On Success (201 Created):
  ```json
  {
      "id": "uuid",
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "title": "New Deck",
      "metadata": {},
      "created_at": "timestamp",
      "updated_at": "timestamp"
  }
  ```
- Possible Error Status Codes:
  - 400 Bad Request: If request parameters or payload are invalid.
  - 401 Unauthorized: If the user is not properly authenticated.
  - 500 Internal Server Error: If database or unexpected errors occur.

## 5. Data Flow
1. A POST request is received at `/api/decks` with the required payload.
2. The API extracts the user information from the authentication context (using Supabase context.locals).
3. Input validation is performed using Zod schemas to ensure that `title` and `metadata` are valid.
4. The deck is created in the database.
5. The created deck record is returned as a response with a 201 status code.

## 6. Security Considerations
- Ensure the user is authenticated using the provided authentication tokens in the request context.
- Validate input using Zod to prevent injection attacks and validate business logic.
- Use parameterized queries via Supabase to prevent SQL injection.

## 7. Error Handling
- 400 Bad Request: Return when validation fails or mandatory fields are missing.
- 401 Unauthorized: Return when the user is not logged in.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Return when database or unexpected errors occur.
- Log errors appropriately for internal tracking and troubleshooting.

## 8. Performance Considerations
- Perform input validations efficiently to limit unnecessary DB interactions.
- Use single database query (INSERT) for optimal performance.
- Leverage database indexes on user_id for efficient queries.

## 9. Implementation Steps
1. **Route Definition:** Create the POST `/api/decks` endpoint in the appropriate Astro pages directory (e.g., `src/pages/api/decks/index.ts`).
2. **Authentication:** Extract and verify user authentication from `context.locals` using the Supabase client provided.
3. **Input Validation:** Use a Zod schema for the `CreateDeckCommand` to validate the incoming request payload.
4. **Service Layer:** Extract the deck creation logic into a service function (e.g., in `src/lib/services/deck.service.ts`) to handle DB operations.
6. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to catch and log errors if:
   - The validation fails (return 400)
   - User authentication is invalid or missing (return 401)
7. **Response:** On successful creation, respond with the created deck details and a 201 status code.
8. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure the endpoint behaves as expected under different scenarios.
